GETTING STARTED

1) Download the compiled javascript library at: 
https://github.com/downloads/richardanaya/WebGLSpriteEngine/SpriteEngine-min.js

2) Go through the simple tutorials at: 
https://github.com/richardanaya/WebGLSpriteEngine/wiki/Tutorials


COMPILING
To compile the javascript library correctly, you'll need some dependencies:

- Java ( http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp )
- Python ( http://www.python.org )

Once you have these, from commandline in the root directory run ./setup.sh (for osx/linux) or setup.bat (for windows)

TESTING
You can run a temporary server in any of the example directories by running ./run_server.sh

TODO LIST:
- find out a way to intuitively preload images and add hooks to monitor progress
- add support for font map rendering
- add a default pixel image that is injected at initialization
- rename shaders to be more unique
- add ability to turn off and on customer shaders during render pipline
